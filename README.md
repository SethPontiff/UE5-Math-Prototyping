Quick project that was used for prototyping existing Math For Games concepts, but in UE5 for visual representation. In the Math Prototyping folder you will find the level, as well as;
- Basic tank movement with auto-aiming turrets.
- Turrets that are firing projectiles that add impulses and move players.
- A target that when shot at tells them which side of the target was hit.
